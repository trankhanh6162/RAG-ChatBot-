# RAG-ChatBot
â€‹My project focuses on developing a chatbot utilizing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), an AI framework that combines the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) with information retrieval systems. This integration enables the chatbot to access and incorporate specific internal data sources, ensuring responses are not only contextually relevant but also grounded in the most current and authoritative information available. By dynamically retrieving pertinent data at the time of each query, the chatbot can provide accurate and up-to-date answers, thereby enhancing user engagement and satisfaction. This approach is particularly beneficial in domains requiring precise and timely information, as it mitigates the risk of outdated or incorrect responses that can occur with static knowledge models. Overall, this project aims to deliver a more reliable and context-aware conversational experience by leveraging the strengths of both generative AI and targeted data retrieval.
